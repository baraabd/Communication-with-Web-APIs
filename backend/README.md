Communication-with-Web-APIs

1. Your own API should be an Express server built in NodeJS that handles any resource. (G)- Yes
2. here must be an endpoint to retrieve all entities from your resource (GET) and an endpoint to create a new entity (POST) (G)- Yes
3. For VG, the API will be expanded with endpoints to update an entity (PUT) (VG)- No
4. delete an entity (DELETE) and retrieve a specific entity (GET) (VG) - No

- In order for the site to work, it needs access to the Src folder, where there is a file for server.js then you need write: node server.js
